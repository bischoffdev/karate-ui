# Karate sample tests

This is the example code from my presentation "Karate - beyond API testing" showcasing

- API test
- UI test
- Combined API and UI test
- API mock
- Mocked API and UI test
- Visual test

## Usage

It uses the Coffee Cart sample available here: https://github.com/jecfish/coffee-cart

To install it, use `npm install`, to run it locally, use `npm run dev`.

The `baseUrl` of the local website can be updated in [karate-config](src/test/java/karate-config.js).
